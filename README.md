The classic game of Solitaire written entirely in Python using Pygame! My first project with Pygame, which took around 4 days to complete.

### Running the game

To run the main script (solitaire.py) using Python (preferably version 3.14.2), you will need both the card module (included in the repo) and pygame-ce (Pygame Community Edition, install using pip).
<br><br>For all-in-one executable files with all dependencies included, check out the releases page [here](https://github.com/jscdev909/Solitaire/releases)!
