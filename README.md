The classic game of Solitaire written entirely in Python using Pygame! My first project with Pygame, which took around 4 days to complete.

### Running the game

To run the main script (solitaire.py) using python, you will need both the card module (included in the repo, provides card helper classes and functions) and pygame-ce (Pygame Community Edition, install using pip).
<br><br>For executable files with all dependencies included, check out the release page!
